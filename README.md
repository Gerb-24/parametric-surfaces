# parametric-surfaces
extension for hammer to create parametric surfaces using displacements

The bezier-drawer script:
this script lets you draw shapes using bezier curves, and when you are satisfied it creates displacements with the same shape

when you start the script you see 4 points in the top left. By pressing 1, 2, 3 or 4 you select that point and by clicking on the plane that point will move to the cursors position.
this way you can make one nice bezier curve
by pressing "a" you add a new bezier curve whose points will all be at the last point. By pressing "c" you go into curve mode where you can select the second curve by pressing 2, which brings you into the handle mode for that curve. This way you can add up to 9 curves.
press space when you want to make the vmf. When it is created the code will stop running. The vmf is named "newmap3.vmf".
